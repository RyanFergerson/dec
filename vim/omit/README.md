# The omit directory

## Overview
Everything (besides the readme and gitignore) placed in omit is ignored by git.

## Example files
Here are some reasons I use the omit directory
* Private configuration (like settings for one special computer or config with plain text password)
* Generated files (like console logs and sql history)
